Couchnado keeps my favorite movies and TV shows handy on Apple TV. Version 3 starts over with a cross-platform [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui) target that adds preliminary support for [visionOS.](https://developer.apple.com/visionos)

### Powered by Spreadsheet

Couchnado's thin veneer of SwiftUI is driven by a single spreadsheet, brought to life by the included [`CouchData`](couchdata/) package.
