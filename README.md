Couchnado keeps my favorite movies and TV shows handy on Apple TV, with a simple, irritation-free interface.

Version 2 ditches Catalyst for Cocoa on the Mac. And, of course, the iPhone and iPad get all new UI as well.

Couchnado's thin veneer of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui) is driven by a single spreadsheet, brought to life by the included [`CouchData`](couchdata/) package.
