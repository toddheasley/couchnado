## Powered by Spreadsheet

Couchnado's thin veneer of [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui) is driven by a single spreadsheet, brought to life by the included [`CouchData`](couchdata/) package.

## Requirements

Written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift) 5.7 and builds in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) 14 or newer.
